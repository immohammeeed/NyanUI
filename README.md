## What is OneUI?

**OneUI** is Samsungâ€™s custom user interface layer for Android. It is designed to make smartphones easier to use with one hand, offering a clean design, intuitive navigation, and exclusive features.

## What is Android Porting?

**Android porting** means adapting an Android OS (and custom UIs like OneUI) to run on hardware it wasnâ€™t originally meant for.  
> *Iâ€™m still learning about porting, so feel free to share tips, resources, or corrections!*
