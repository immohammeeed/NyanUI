## About NyanUI

NyanUI is a future project that aims to port OneUI to the Galaxy S10 series. Development has not yet started; the project will begin once I have gained more experience and knowledge about Android porting. The goal is to eventually provide a stable, feature-rich, and visually cohesive OneUI experience to Galaxy S10 users, even if their devices are no longer officially supported by Samsung.

## What is OneUI?

**OneUI** is Samsungâ€™s custom user interface layer for Android. It is designed to make smartphones easier to use with one hand, offering a clean design, intuitive navigation, and exclusive features that enhance the overall user experience. OneUI builds on top of the standard Android operating system, introducing Samsung-specific enhancements, themes, and applications.

## What is Android Porting?

**Android porting** involves adapting a version of the Android operating system (and its custom user interfaces, like OneUI) to run on hardware for which it was not originally designed. (im still learning about it btw)
